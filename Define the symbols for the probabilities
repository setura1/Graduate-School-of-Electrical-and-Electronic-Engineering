import sympy as sp

# Define the symbols for the probabilities
p0, p1, p2 = sp.symbols('p0 p1 p2')

# Define the expressions based on the equations
p_Y = p0 + p1 - 2 * p0 * p1
p_Z = p0 + p1 + p2 - 2 * (p0 * p1 + p0 * p2 + p1 * p2) + 4 * p0 * p1 * p2
p_Z_given_Y = (p0 + p1 - 2 * p0 * p1) * (1 - p2)

# Conditional probability
p_conditional = p_Z_given_Y / p_Z

# Simplify the expression
p_conditional_simplified = sp.simplify(p_conditional)

# Output the result
